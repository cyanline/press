The image was moved off FDAS via a network connection,” explained Branigan. “Now we have taken it further.”</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">“Analysts can remotely review the image that is on FDAS, or the image can be copied from the source drive directly onto a SANS via FDAS and bypass our internal storage,” Branigan said. “It is a natural next step.”</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Cloud-based forensics eliminate the need for an investigator to begin the collection process, pause it, then plug in the drive to a different computer, just to see if they were even collecting the right data. “Now, investigators can see the forensic image in real-time, and the network can already be set up, saving time, money and stress over producing forensically sound images.”</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">FDAS offers a solution that is easy to use, secure and fast with its integrated web interface.
