## Introducing Forensic Imager On a Thumb Drive

date: March 14, 2014


CyanLine is now offering MiniDAS, forensic imaging software that
collects metadata that can change the outcomes of investigations.


*Eatontown, NJ* -- CyanLine, a leader in computer forensics and network security solutions, has introduced MiniDAS, a portable, installable, live forensic analysis environment that provides the most comprehensive collection of forensic data possible. Inspired by CyanLine's FDAS, MiniDAS allows investigators to not only collect a disk image - but also its critical metadata: total number of hours disk has been in use, power cycle count, errors on the drive.


"We compressed an entire imaging system into a Forensic Live ISO that is usable via DVD or USB stick," explained Steven Branigan, CyanLine CEO and FDAS inventor. "Not every situation allows for backpacks of equipment - so we were asked by our customer to provide a slimmed-down tool." MiniDAS' interface guides users through the acquisition process. With the brains of [FDAS](http://www.cyanline.com/fdas.php) and based on [Kali Linux](http://www.kali.org/), this operating system provides an easy acquisition process and suite of digital, network, RAM, and password forensic tools.


The original FDAS (Fast-Disk Acquisition System) is a turn-key system with network capability that captures an image on a RAID array for fastest possible acquisition. FDAS pioneered forensic metadata capture. That feature, metadata capture is an integral part of MiniDAS. "Most investigators (and attorneys) don't even know that the metadata exists - and that it can change the outcome of an investigation," explained Branigan. "Investigators can use MiniDAS to find information about the disk drive itself, including the number of hours it's been in use and how many times a device was turned on."


"If investigators search a three-year-old computer, but see in the metadata that it was only in use for 20 hours, they can infer that the suspect's disk offered incorrect evidence," Branigan stated. "CyanLine is on a mission to make these agencies aware that this data exists since it can be the difference in whether a criminal either walks away unscathed or pays for their crimes."


MiniDAS can be downloaded directly from CyanLine for $50 and is available for free for law enforcement. "We want to make sure local, domestic and international law enforcement agencies that are facing budget crises have access to this entirely new computer forensic data-collecting software." Companies in the metro-New York and Philadelphia areas that are interested in CyanLine's FDAS can test-drive that unit for 7 days for free.
