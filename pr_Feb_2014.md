Forensic security solutions leader CyanLine announces breakthrough
cloud-based forensics technology that allows analysis of forensic
evidence over a network interface in real-time


*Eatontown, NJ* -- CyanLine, a New Jersey-based company dedicated to the prevention, detection, and investigation of cyber crimes, announced that its groundbreaking [computer forensic imaging system](http://www.cyanline.com/fdas.php), FDAS, now enables "cloud-based forensics." With the addition of network capability, FDAS can transmit directly to a secure SANS environment to allow investigators to collaborate on evidentiary images.


"The cloud model is so popular because it enables collaboration," explained Steven Branigan. "By leveraging the cloud we can facilitate collaboration in a way that has never been possible." He added that police departments are burdened with having to copy images to media at the request of attorney's from on both sides. "FDAS allows images to be copied to a SANS directly from the field, bypassing the need to handle, manage and store physical drives."


FDAS was designed to rapidly image disks by using RAID disks inside a closed unit. "Our first goal was to simplify and significantly speed up the collection process and image to our internal disks. The image was moved off FDAS via a network connection," explained Branigan. "Now we have taken it further."


"Analysts can remotely review the image that is on FDAS, or the image can be copied from the source drive directly onto a SANS via FDAS and bypass our internal storage," Branigan said. "It is a natural next step."


Cloud-based forensics eliminate the need for an investigator to begin the collection process, pause it, then plug in the drive to a different computer, just to see if they were even collecting the right data. "Now, investigators can see the forensic image in real-time, and the network can already be set up, saving time, money and stress over producing forensically sound images."


FDAS offers a solution that is easy to use, secure and fast with its integrated web interface. For more information about this pioneering capability, visit, [http://www.CyanLine.com](http://www.CyanLine.com).
